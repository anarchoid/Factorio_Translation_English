[technology-description]
iron-working=Basic technology needed to create better iron items.
automation=Key technology for large scale production.
logistic-robotics=Logistic robots are a flexibile alternative to conveyor belts.
logistics=Faster and more flexible ways of transportation.
solar-energy=Source of infinite energy, but useless at night.
laser-turrets=Laser turrets are second tier defensive structures. They need electricity, but no ammunition.
turrets=Allows the building of basic defending structures.
rocket-defense=Rocket defense is needed to defend the landing of our ships.
steel-processing=Allows the smelting of iron plates into steel bars.
automated-rail-transportation=Enables to build stations, these can be used to setup automated train routes.
rail-signals=Enables to organize multiple trains on single rail network
electric-energy-accumulators=Accumulators are used to store electric energy.
inserter-stack-size-bonus=When inserters are moving from one container to another (or loading/unloading trains) they can move more items at the same time.
character-logistic-slots=Allows player to order items from storage and provider chests. These items will be delivered by the logistic robots.
modules=Opens door to the upgrade modules researches.
speed-module=Speed modules push the machine speed to the limit but they increase the energy consumption
productivity-module=Productivity modules push the machine productivity to the limit (Enables to make more products from the same amount of ingredients) but they increase the energy consumption.
effectivity-module=Effectivity modules decrease the energy consumption of machines.
combat-robotics=Combat robots help to fight the enemy with their guns. They are spawned from the capsules and have a limited lifetime. Some follow the player.
toolbelt=Adds second quickbar. This is especially useful for storing capsules.
follower-robot-count=Adds to the maximum count of active following robots at the same time.
